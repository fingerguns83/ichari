# ichari

**ichari** is a community organization tool for Minecraft Servers in the early stages of development.

**ichari** aims to be the equivalent of a company's "intranet", where players can handle land claims; manage and search shops and shop stock; view server events; create and participate in polls; and organize projects.

As the project has grown, an increasing amount of overhead and needless complexity has arisen. Due to this unnecessary...spaghettification...of the code base, I have stepped back and started re-structuring the app from the ground up (you should see my notebooks right now). The nature of SMP gameplay lends itself well to an object-oriented system and I need to start refactoring it into a more universally applicable solution, rather than hardcoding our server's needs.
